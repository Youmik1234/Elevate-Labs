This project is a simple console-based calculator developed in Java. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program takes user input using the Scanner class and displays the result on the console. It uses loops and conditional statements for operation control and runs until the user chooses to exit.
Developed using Java (JDK) in VS Code with Terminal execution for practice with basic I/O and control structures.
